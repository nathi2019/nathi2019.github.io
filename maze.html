The Maze is one the assignments I was able to complete on-time and correctly. At first I had to read it over and over
to understand the question. I have taken time some time on figuring out how to select the boundaries, I first managed to
write a jQuery selector which ($('div#start div#end')). however i find this method ackward and later switched to
$('div.boundary') selector. The tutorials on the W3 have helped me understand the assignment. This assignment took me about
1.5hrs. I have also taken time to comment the code! As usual you can see the assignment on my github

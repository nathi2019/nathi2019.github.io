<!--
	though I have been reading this assignment a day before,  I have come across some difficulties. I think
	this is due the lack of clarity of the questions. I was able to answer questions a, b and c easily .
	However, question d is vogue. I understand it as if we need to create a Bank class on a separate js file
	that has its own functions. i did write those but I could not link them to associated classes [CheckingAccount ,
	SavingAccount and Account].
	Because of this, I was not able to read deposits of each accounts and endOfMonth() method was not able to
	generate the required output for each account!
